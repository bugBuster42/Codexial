# Codexial Project

## Description
Codexial is a project developed as a two-day solo exercise. It's designed as an application for pharmacy representatives, enabling them to record the number of boxes sold in a pharmacy each day. The application also includes an admin panel for reviewing these sales data.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- MySQL
- Composer

## Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```
    and run:

3. **Load Data Fixtures**
   
    - After setting up your environment, load the data fixtures to populate the application with sample data:
